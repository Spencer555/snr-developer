typescript is a static typed lang so u must specify the the variable explicity before using them


pro of statically typed langs 
1 we get documentation
this makes it easy to get on if u pick up the projcet 
e.g 
function sum(a:number, b:number){
    return a + b
}
sum('hello', null)
this would error out before we even put it in production

you get less bugs 
u spend less time in debuging semantics so u can focus on debuging logic 


cons 
it makes our code harder to learn its an extra layer of complexity
dont forget about unit test because u have static typing 
it leads to slower dev process because u have to check for type errors


javascript is weekly typed 
var a  = 'booya'
a + 17 
would give you 'booya17'

but with typescript it would error out



how to make javascript strongly typed 
all these tools goal is to make javascript less nicer and introduce static typing 

flow - add types to js by writing code that works with flow and putting it through a complier that spits js, flow is a static type checker 

// @flow - we add this to the top of our file and relies on babel to remove all the types we added before it goes to production 
this comes with create react app

typescript - by microsoft - it has it own compiler it is a superset of javascript(it add functionaliy on top of js)

reason ml   - based on okamel a programming lang this is created by facebook to make it easy for js developer to pick up 

the difference between typescript and reason is that reason is a seprate language on it own but typescript tries to mimic js and grow with it but reason does not depend on it

angular is built with typescript and using typescript



when to use typescript

1 your project grows larger
2 u have test written 
3 code to be self documenting 
4 budget to train people to learn a new lang 
5 to slow down the development cycle because we are writing more code now



to run typescript 
npm install typescript 
tsc filename


to initialize a typescript project 

tsc --init


to run in watch mode 
every time u save it would recompile
tsc filename.ts --watch


add typescript to it 
npm install typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
npx tsc --init
